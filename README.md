# Scrimba - JS Project (Re-Coded)

After going through Scrimba's "Making Websites Interactive -> Build A BlackJack Game" course module, which showed how to make the app section by section, I decided to code it again from scratch in my own code editor. (Module can be found at: https://scrimba.com/playlist/pZKKKHv)

### The Challenge 

To build a Blackjack game that is basic but functional. For my own version, I kept all the functionality the same as the practice project, and tweaked the design slightly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I put into practice what I learned about calling functions and integrating them with the DOM. In this project, I created a random number generator and used that to generate new cards for the game. I applied conditionals, a for loop, objects, and arrays to create the game conditions. 

### Continued development

I learned so much building this app. I'm looking forward to applying what I learned to build other apps, be they similar games requiring random number generators or other interactive web apps.
